Implemented Features
Core Backend & Database
Supabase Integration: Full integration with a Supabase PostgreSQL database for all data persistence.

Comprehensive Schema: Four distinct tables have been created and secured:

donations: Records all donations, linked to a transaction ID.

bookings: Records all event ticket bookings, including transaction ID, event date, and time.

contacts: Stores all submissions from the contact form.

speaker_registrations: Stores all applications from potential speakers.

Row Level Security (RLS): RLS is enabled on all tables with specific INSERT and SELECT policies to ensure data is secure by default and only accessible as needed.

Payment & Transaction Flow
PhonePe Integration: A complete, end-to-end payment flow using the PhonePe sandbox environment is integrated.

Secure Two-Step Confirmation: A robust payment logic is implemented for both donations and bookings. Data is only saved to the database after a payment is successfully verified, preventing phantom records.

Unified Status Page: A generic PaymentStatus page handles the final confirmation logic for both donations and bookings, providing a clean user experience.

Transaction ID Recording: The unique transaction ID from PhonePe is now successfully captured and saved in the database for every donation and booking, enabling easy auditing and customer support.

User-Facing Features
Real-time Seat Availability: The event booking page fetches real-time data from Supabase to disable already booked seats, preventing double-booking.

Automated Email Confirmations:

A Supabase Edge Function (send-booking-email) is deployed and active.

A PostgreSQL database trigger automatically calls this function after every successful booking insertion.

The function uses the Resend API to send a professional, detailed confirmation email to the user, including their name, event details, and seat numbers.

Functional Forms: The "Send a Message" and "Register as a Speaker" forms are fully integrated and securely save all submissions to the database.

Key Bug Fixes
The critical 404 Redirect Error after payment has been resolved by correcting the redirectMode.

The Premature Database Update issue has been fixed by implementing the two-step confirmation logic.
